                        <i>A lot of course teach machine learning online but none of them teach machine learning the way
                            a beginner should be taught.
                            Most of the courses extensively talk about the mathematical constructs from day one without
                            giving time to the new learning
                            to settle in and get a hang of it.</i>

            <p>
                In this blog post I'll teach machine learning the way a beginner should be taught. So let's get
                started...
            </p>
            <p>
                There are only 4 steps in any machine learning implementation
                <ul>
                    <li>Hypothesis</li>
                    <li>Prediction</li>
                    <li>Cost function</li>
                    <li>Model Training</li>
                </ul>
                We will discuss each of them below
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                <i>A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon</i><br><br>
                A quick Google search gave me this definition of <b>Hypothesis</b>. A <i>proposed explanation?</i>Hmmm,
                what does that has to do with machine
                learning? Well, in machine learning we have data(we only talk about csv files here, csv files are
                similar to excel sheets) which should follow
                some mathematical equation(assumption, we propose that it does). This mathematical function is what we
                call a <b>Hypothesis</b> of a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Not clear with hypothesis yet?</b> Let's look at an example:<br>
                consider this data<br><br>
                <div class="user-content">
                    <img src="../../public/images/blog/datapoints.png">
                </div><br><br>
                Here, as you can see, we have 2 columns representing years of experience and the respective salary of
                the employee.
                In ML one row of such data is called a datapoint. Now if we were to plot a scatter plot of this data we
                would get something
                like this<br><br>
                <div class="user-content">
                    <img src="../../public/images/blog/plot.png">
                </div><br><br>
                Do you see a pattern? I bet you do. This graph loosly resembles a straight line, doesn't it? Now here we
                propose that
                this data resembles a straight line. This straight line is our <i>hypothesis</i>.
                <br><b>That is, we assume that a model
                    based on this straight line can predict values from future datapoint that might appear in this
                    dataset.</b><br>
                So, let's draw a line<br>
                <div class="user-content">
                    <img src="../../public/images/blog/lineplot.png">
                </div><br><br>
                <h3><b>This line is a hypothesis for a linear regression model</b></h3>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <h2>Prediction</h2>
                <i>Now we use the above discussed hypothesis to do prediction</i><br><br>
                <b>But how?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Let's talk a bit about maths here<br>
                    A straight line is represented as y = mx + c. Here, m is the slop of the line, c is the y-intercept,
                    x
                    is
                    the dependent
                    variable and y is what we get when we plug in the value of m, c and x. Now, if I were to ask you to
                    draw
                    a straight line
                    on this scatter plot your would probably try to find the best value of m and c so draw this line.
                    That's
                    exactly what a computer
                    does. To begin with, the computer chooses a random value of m and c and then feed in x ( which in
                    this
                    case is years of experience).
                    These three values gives us y which is out prediction from this <i>proposed</i> model based on a
                    straight line.
                </p>
            </p><hr>
            <p>
                <h2>Cost Function</h2>
                <i>How does the computer know whether to increase the value of m or decrease the value of c to get the best fit line?</i>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    This is where things become interesting.
